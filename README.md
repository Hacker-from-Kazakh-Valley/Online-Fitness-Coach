# Online-Fitness-Coach

**Overview**
Welcome to the Online Fitness Coach project, a full-stack application developed using JavaScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS. This fitness platform is designed to provide users with a dynamic and personalized exercise experience, offering a vast array of exercises with detailed information and video demonstrations.

**Features**
Dynamic Exercise Categories: We have created a website with dynamic exercise categories, allowing users to easily select exercises based on their preferred muscle groups. This feature enhances user experience and customization.

RapidAPI Integration: To enrich our exercise database, we have utilized data fetching techniques with RapidAPI. This integration provides access to a vast collection of exercises and allows us to integrate YouTube video content for comprehensive exercise information and video demonstrations.

Custom Exercise Distribution: The project includes a custom distribution of exercises into several categories, adding more than 50 additional exercises. This ensures a diverse range of workout options for users.
